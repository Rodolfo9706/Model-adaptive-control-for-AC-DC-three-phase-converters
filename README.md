# Model-adaptive-control-for-AC-DC-three-phase-converters
This repository contains the implementation of a Lyapunov-based nonlinear adaptive controller for three-phase AC/DC converters under exogenous disturbances and load variations. The control strategy ensures output voltage regulation and addresses the challenges of bilinear and underactuated system dynamics.
